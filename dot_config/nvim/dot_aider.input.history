+What are some issues you can see with this implementation?

# 2025-04-16 10:16:07.146029
+I'd like to make this work better -- the current setup for my python projects is working well so I need to make sure I don't break anything. Can you suggest a way we can make a test harness around this that we can use to make iterative changes against as we tackle the issues you see above?

# 2025-04-16 10:18:15.623473

+Great -- so next I want to think about LSP and linting etc... Currently for Python projects nvim/lazyvim is set up with Pyright. For work here we use MyPy. Is there a way to easily switch?

# 2025-04-16 13:37:50.829142
+The project specific MyPy option is ideal. We do have a mypi.ini file at the project root.
