## PROCESS

### Step 1: Argument Extraction

Read the paper and extract every distinct claim, premise, and inference. Produce an **argument map** — a hierarchical structure showing how the paper's reasoning flows from evidence to conclusions.

```
# Argument Map: [Paper Title]

## Thesis / Central Claim
[The paper's main argument in one sentence]

## Supporting Argument 1: [Label]
**Claim:** [what the paper asserts]
**Premises:**
  - P1: [evidence or assumption this claim rests on]
  - P2: [evidence or assumption]
**Inference type:** [deductive / inductive / abductive / analogical]
**Evidence cited:** [what data or sources support this]
**Depends on:** [which other arguments this one requires]

## Supporting Argument 2: [Label]
[repeat]

## Argument Dependencies
[Directed graph of which arguments depend on which — identify the critical path]
```

### Step 1.5: Internal Consistency Scan

Before evaluating individual arguments, systematically check that the paper does not contradict itself. Contradictions separated by many paragraphs are easy to miss during linear reading — this step forces an exhaustive cross-referencing pass.

#### 1.5.1 Claim-Level Consistency

For each core claim or design principle extracted in Step 1:
- **Search the full paper** for language that contradicts, weakens, or qualifies the claim
- Pay special attention to the gap between *principles* (often stated in the introduction) and *descriptions* (often stated in methods/design sections) — a principle declared as foundational in §1 must not be described as optional in §3
- Flag any claim whose status shifts between sections (required ↔ optional, universal ↔ conditional, validated ↔ hypothetical) without explicit acknowledgment of the shift

#### 1.5.2 Terminology Consistency

- Identify key terms that carry architectural or argumentative weight (e.g., "content-agnostic," "required," "optional," "validated," "provenance")
- For each term, check that its meaning and scope remain stable across all uses
- Flag equivocation: same term used with different scopes or implications in different sections

#### 1.5.3 Dependency Integrity

- Using the argument dependency graph from Step 1, trace each critical-path argument to its dependencies
- For each dependency, verify that the depended-upon claim is not undermined elsewhere in the paper
- Specifically check: if Claim A depends on Component B, does the paper anywhere describe Component B as optional, unimplemented, or unnecessary?

#### 1.5.4 Abstract–Body Alignment

- Compare the abstract's framing of each major claim against how that claim appears in the body
- Flag any claim that is stronger in the abstract than its body treatment supports, or that uses different framing language (e.g., abstract says "requires" but body says "can optionally use")

```
## Internal Consistency Report

### Contradictions Found
| # | Claim A (Location) | Claim B (Location) | Nature of Contradiction |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |

### Terminology Shifts
| Term | Meaning in [Section] | Meaning in [Section] | Problematic? |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | Yes/No |

### Broken Dependency Chains
| Conclusion | Depends On | But Paper Says | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Abstract–Body Mismatches
| Abstract Claim | Body Treatment | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... |
```

**Note:** Contradictions found here are often the highest-impact findings in the entire audit. A paper with locally valid arguments that globally contradict each other has a more serious problem than a paper with a weak individual inference — the former suggests the author hasn't fully worked out their own position.

### Step 2: Logical Audit

For each argument in the map, evaluate:

#### 2.1 Validity of Inference

| Argument | Inference Type | Valid? | Issue (if any) |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | ... | Yes/No/Partial | ... |

Check for:
- **Non sequitur**: Conclusion doesn't follow from premises
- **Affirming the consequent**: "If A then B; B; therefore A"
- **Hasty generalization**: Small sample → broad claim
- **False dichotomy**: Presenting two options when more exist
- **Equivocation**: Same term used with different meanings
- **Circular reasoning**: Conclusion assumed in premises
- **Post hoc ergo propter hoc**: Temporal sequence treated as causation
- **Appeal to authority**: Citation used as proof rather than evidence
- **Straw man**: Misrepresenting opposing views to dismiss them
- **Composition/division**: Attributing properties of parts to whole or vice versa

#### 2.2 Premise Evaluation

For each premise:
- **Stated or unstated?** Unstated premises (hidden assumptions) are the most dangerous
- **Empirically supported?** Is evidence provided, and is it adequate?
- **Contested?** Would reasonable scholars dispute this premise?
- **Scope-appropriate?** Does the premise actually apply to the context claimed?

#### 2.3 Evidence-Claim Alignment

For each claim backed by evidence:
- Does the evidence actually support the specific claim made (not just a related claim)?
- Is the evidence sufficient (not just a single study or anecdote)?
- Are there alternative explanations for the evidence that the paper doesn't consider?
- Is there known contradictory evidence the paper ignores?

### Step 3: Gap Analysis

Identify:

```
## Argument Gaps

### Unsupported Claims
[Claims made without evidence or reasoning]
- **Claim:** [quote] — **Location:** [section/paragraph]
- **What's needed:** [what evidence or argument would support this]

### Hidden Assumptions
[Premises the argument requires but never states]
- **Assumption:** [what's being assumed]
- **Where it operates:** [which arguments depend on it]
- **Risk:** [what happens to the argument if this assumption is wrong]

### Missing Counterarguments
[Objections a critical reader would raise that the paper doesn't address]
- **Objection:** [what a skeptic would say]
- **Applies to:** [which argument]
- **Severity:** [would this undermine a minor point or the central thesis?]

### Scope Overreach
[Where conclusions go beyond what the evidence supports]
- **Claim:** [what the paper says]
- **Evidence supports:** [what the evidence actually shows]
- **Gap:** [the distance between evidence and claim]

### Inferential Leaps
[Where the paper jumps from A to C without establishing B]
- **From:** [established point]
- **To:** [claimed conclusion]
- **Missing step:** [what needs to be argued]
```

### Step 4: Strength Assessment

Not just weaknesses — identify what the argument does well:

```
## Argument Strengths
- [Well-constructed arguments, elegant reasoning, effective use of evidence]

## Strongest Links
[The most well-supported inferences in the paper]

## Weakest Links
[The inferences most vulnerable to challenge — if these fail, what collapses?]
```

### Step 5: Synthesis Report

```
## Argument Audit Summary

**Overall logical coherence:** [Strong / Moderate / Weak]
**Critical vulnerabilities:** [count] — issues that threaten the central thesis
**Moderate issues:** [count] — weaken individual arguments but don't collapse the thesis
**Minor issues:** [count] — presentation or precision problems

### The Strongest Version of This Argument
[Restate the paper's argument in its strongest possible form — steelman it.
What would the paper look like if all gaps were filled?]

### What Must Be Fixed
[Prioritized list of logical repairs, ordered by impact on the central thesis]

### Recommended Revisions
[Specific, actionable suggestions for strengthening the argument]
1. **[Issue]** — [What to do about it, with specific location in paper]
```

## IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES

- **Steelman first**: Before criticizing, make sure you understand the argument in its strongest form. Misrepresenting the argument to find flaws is itself a logical error.
- **Distinguish logical from empirical**: A valid argument can have false premises. An invalid argument can have true premises. Separate these assessments.
- **Hidden assumptions matter most**: The claims the paper doesn't realize it's making are more dangerous than the ones it makes explicitly.
- **Not all gaps are fatal**: Some gaps are easily filled, some are standard practice in the field. Focus on gaps that actually threaten the argument.
- **Be specific**: "The logic is weak" is useless. "The inference from X to Y on page 4 assumes Z, which is contested by [source]" is useful.
