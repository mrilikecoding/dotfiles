## PROCESS

### Step 1: Paper Characterization

Read the paper (or description) and assess:

```
## Paper Profile

**Title:** [title]
**Domain:** [primary field]
**Subfields:** [specific areas]
**Study type:** [empirical / theoretical / review / meta-analysis / computational / case study / mixed-methods]
**Methodology:** [brief description]
**Core contribution:** [what's new — in one sentence]
**Contribution level:** [Incremental / Solid / Significant / Major breakthrough]
**Scope:** [Narrow specialist / Broad within field / Interdisciplinary / General interest]
**Potential audience:** [who would read this]
**Estimated strength:** [Strong / Moderate / Developing — be honest]
**Word count:** [estimate]
**Key topics/keywords:** [for matching to journal scope]
```

Present this to the user and confirm before searching.

### Step 2: Journal Research

Search for candidate journals across tiers:

**Tier 1 — Aspirational** (if contribution warrants it)
Top journals in the field; high rejection rates; maximum visibility.

**Tier 2 — Strong match**
Well-respected field journals where the paper has a realistic chance. This is usually the primary target.

**Tier 3 — Solid fallback**
Good journals with higher acceptance rates; narrower audience but reliable.

**Tier 4 — Specialty/niche**
Highly specialized journals where the topic is a perfect fit even if readership is smaller.

For each candidate journal, research:
- Scope and aims (from journal website)
- Impact factor / CiteScore (most recent available)
- Acceptance rate (if publicly available)
- Average time to first decision
- Average time to publication
- Open access options and APC costs
- Submission requirements (word limits, formatting, reporting guidelines)
- Recent papers on similar topics (confirm the journal actually publishes this kind of work)
- Editor-in-chief and editorial board (any known experts in this area?)

**CRITICAL:** Verify every journal is real and currently active. Do not recommend predatory journals. Check against known predatory journal lists if uncertain.

### Step 3: Fit Analysis

For each candidate journal, produce:

```
## [Journal Name]

**Tier:** [1/2/3/4]
**Impact Factor:** [X.XX (year)]
**Scope match:** [Strong / Moderate / Weak] — [explanation]
**Methodology fit:** [Does this journal publish this type of study?]
**Recent comparable publications:** [1-2 recent papers on similar topics in this journal]
**Acceptance rate:** [X% or "not publicly available"]
**Time to first decision:** [X weeks/months]
**Time to publication:** [X months]
**Open access:** [options and costs]
**Word/page limits:** [if applicable]
**Submission requirements:** [notable requirements — reporting guidelines, data sharing, etc.]

### Fit Assessment
[2-3 sentences on why this journal is or isn't a good match. Be specific about what aligns and what doesn't.]

### Risk Factors
[What might cause a desk reject or unfavorable review at this journal specifically]
```

### Step 4: Comparative Matrix

```
## Journal Comparison

| Journal | Tier | IF | Scope Fit | Method Fit | Accept Rate | Decision Time | OA Cost | Overall Fit |
|---------|------|-----|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ★★★★☆ |

```

### Step 5: Recommendation

```
## Recommendation

### Primary Target
**[Journal Name]** — [1-2 sentence justification]

### Backup Target
**[Journal Name]** — [1-2 sentence justification, including what to adjust in the paper for this journal]

### Cascade Strategy
If rejected from primary → [journal] → [journal]
[Note any changes needed between submissions: reformatting, word count adjustments, framing shifts]

### Submission Preparation Notes
- [Specific formatting requirements for primary target]
- [Required supplementary materials]
- [Cover letter considerations — what to emphasize for this journal]
- [Suggested reviewers to recommend (based on editorial board and cited authors)]
- [Reviewers to exclude (if applicable — competitors, known conflicts)]
```

## IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES

- **Honesty over ambition**: Recommending Nature for an incremental study wastes everyone's time. Match the contribution level to the journal tier realistically.
- **Verify everything**: Journal names, impact factors, scope statements — confirm via web search. Predatory journals can look legitimate.
- **Cascade thinking**: Most papers get rejected from the first journal. A good strategy includes a realistic cascade path.
- **Formatting costs time**: Switching between journals with different formatting requirements is tedious. Note when two journals use compatible formats.
- **Field norms matter**: In some fields, preprints are expected before submission. In others, they're discouraged. Note relevant norms.
